Plugin for CudaText.
It works in HTML/CSS/JavaScript files (any lexer name with words "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript").
It finds HTML color tokens: #rgb #rrggbb; and adds nice colored tooltips for them. 
When you move mouse cursor over color tokens, tooltip appears.

It finds colors:
- on opening file,
- after text is changed + pause passed (CudaText option "py_change_slow").
If you're interested, what is HSL display, see
